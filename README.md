# opening_hours_server.js

A little server daemon answering queryâ€˜s for [opening_hours][Key:opening_hours] and check if they can be evaluated. It was created to integrate opening_hours validation support into the [qat_script][] (see [pull request for integration](https://github.com/simone-f/qat_script/pull/5)).

It works by querying the requested data from the [OverpassAPI][], then fed it to [opening_hours.js][oh-lib] to see if it can be evaluated.
